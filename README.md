# Playing around Linux Kernel project

This repo was meant to store small and simple projects/codes written while I'm
reading and learning new things about Linux Kernel. But pay attention, it was
made for personal use only! If you have any suggestion feel free to comment, but
if you have plans to use these codes, it's your call and your own decision, good
luck: there might be code that his outdated, incomplete, not working properly or
even not working.

One day I'll update my blog at http://bmeneg.com and add some posts about these
codes.
